## Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python

### Learning Goals

Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

### Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? (Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

### My Goals:

-   Learn, become familiar and comfortable with CML interface and coding in Python.

-   I want to create a simple game using Python at the end of this course.

-   I am interested in creating a CML version CV and want to give that a go.

#### Notes:

-   Install pip: `python3 -m pip install`

-   Start Python in CML: `python`

-   Open a Python file in CML : `python <file name>`

-   Install package with pip: `pip install <package name>`

-   Install virtual environment: `pip install virtualenvwrapper`

-   Create a new virtual environment: `mkvirtualenv <environment name>`

-   Exit a virtual environment: `deactivate`

-   Bring up/check out the list of existing virtual environment: `workon`

-   Entre a virtual environment: `workon < environment name>`

-   Delete a virtual environment: `rmvirtualenv <enviroment name>`
